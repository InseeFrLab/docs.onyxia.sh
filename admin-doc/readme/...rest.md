# ðŸ”“ Vault

{% hint style="info" %}
Vault is also used by Onyxia as the persistance layer for all savec configuration. If you don't have a vault all user setings are stored in the local storage.
{% endhint %}

Onyxia-web use vault as a storage for two kinds of secrets :\
1\. secrets or information generate by Onyxia to store differents values (ui preferences for example)\
2\. user secrets\
\
Vault must be configured with JWT or OIDC authentification methods.

As vault need to be initialized with a master key, It can't be directly configured with all parameters such as oidc or access policies and roles. So first step we create a vault with dev mode (do not use this in production and do your initialization with any of the recommanded configuration : shamir, gcp, another vault)

```bash
helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
 
DOMAIN=my-domain.net

cat << EOF > ./vault-values.yaml
server:
  dev:
    enabled: true
    # Set VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID value
    devRootToken: "root"
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    hosts:
      - host: "vault.lab.$DOMAIN"
    tls:
      - hosts:
          - vault.lab.$DOMAIN
EOF

helm install vault hashicorp/vault -f vault-values.yaml
```

Create a client called "vault"

1. _Root URL_: **https://vault.lab.my-domain.net/**
2. _Valid redirect URIs_: **https://vault.lab.my-domain.net/\***
3. _Web origins_: **\***
