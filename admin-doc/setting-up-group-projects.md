# ðŸ‘¥ Setting up group projects

The user interface of onyxia enables to create projects for groups of Onyxia users. &#x20;

Users will be able to dynamically switch from one project to another using a select input in the header.

This select doesn't appear when the user isn't in any group project. &#x20;

All users of a group project share:

* The Kubernetes namespace, in "My Services" you can see everything that's running, including services launched by other person of the group. &#x20;
* Project settings. If a user change a project setting, it affects every member of the group.
* Secrets
* S3 Bucket (or an S3 subpath)

As of today, new group can only be created by Onyxia instance administrator, on demand and the procedure to create group is not publicly documented yet because we're still actively working on it.  \
However, if you want to enable this feature for your users, reach us, we will guide you through it! &#x20;
