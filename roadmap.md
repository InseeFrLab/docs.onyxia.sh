# Roadmap

This roadmap shows the futur development of core team of the Onyxia project :&#x20;

* Transform the file browser into a data explorer

The main idea of this work is to help a datascientist to see first few lines of parquet files ( maybe csv and json also ) directly in the onyxia-web interface. It can give a fast access to a basic SQL engine in DuckDB Wasm.

* Accessibility

Onyxia is not yet accessible and this is a priority to change that

* Offering more options to manage S3

Onyxia is not able to make quota for S3 buckets neither creating custom policies. Those task are delegate to other administrators. We will releasing an S3 operator in order tom manage onboarding on S3.
