# ðŸ’» Setting up your dev environment in Onyxia

In this video, we guide you through setting up your development environment in Onyxia. We demonstrate how to automatically clone your Git repository, install any missing dependencies, and open a port for your development server.

I forgot to show in the video that you can setup your GitHub/GitLab username and token in My Account -> External services.

This will enable Onyxia to close even private repos! &#x20;
