## Oneliner

If you are already familiar with Kubernetes and Helm, here's how you can get an Onyxia instance up and running in just a matter of seconds.

```bash
helm repo add onyxia https://inseefrlab.github.io/onyxia

cat << EOF > ./onyxia-values.yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  hosts:
    - host: onyxia.my-domain.net
EOF

helm install onyxia onyxia/onyxia -f onyxia-values.yaml

# Navigate to https://onyxia.my-domain.net
```

With this minimal configuration, you'll have an Onyxia instance operating in a degraded mode, which lacks features such as authentication, S3 explorer, secret management, etc. However, you will still retain the capability to launch services from the catalog.
