# üèÅ Installing

This is a step by step guide that will assist you in installing Onyxia. &#x20;

### Provision a Kubernetes cluster

First you'll need a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster.  If you have one already you can skip this section.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Provisioning a cluster on AWS, GCP or Azure" %}
[Hashicorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/) maintains great tutorials for [terraforming](https://www.terraform.io/) Kubernetes clusters on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) or [Azure](https://acloudguru.com/videos/acg-fundamentals/what-is-microsoft-azure).&#x20;

Pick one of the three and follow the guide.&#x20;

You can stop after the [configure kubectl section](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/eks#configure-kubectl). &#x20;

{% embed url="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/aks?in=terraform/kubernetes" %}

### Ingress controller &#x20;

Deploy an ingress controller on your cluster:

```bash
# AWS: 
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.2.0/deploy/static/provider/aws/deploy.yaml
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
[The above command](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#aws) is for AWS. &#x20;

For GCP use [this command](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#gce-gke).

For Azure use [this command](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#azure).
{% endhint %}

### DNS

Let's assume you own the domain name **my-domain.net**, for the rest of the guide you should replace **my-domain.net** by a domain you actually own. &#x20;

Now you need to get the external address of your cluster, run the command&#x20;

```bash
kubectl get services -n ingress-nginx
```

and write down the `External IP` assigned to the `LoadBalancer`.&#x20;

Depending on the cloud provider you are using it can be an IPv4, an IPv6 or a domain. On AWS for example, it will be a domain like **xxx.elb.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com**. &#x20;

If you see `<pending>`, wait a few seconds and try again. &#x20;

Once you have the address, create the following DNS records:

```dns-zone-file
onyxia.my-domain.net CNAME xxx.elb.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com. 
*.lab.my-domain.net  CNAME xxx.elb.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com. 
```

If the address you got was an IPv4 (`x.x.x.x`), create a `A` record instead of a CNAME.

If the address you got was ans IPv6 (`y:y:y:y:y:y:y:y`), create a `AAAA` record.

**https://onyxia.my-domain.net** will be the URL for your instance of Onyxia. The URL of the services created by Onyxia are going to look like: **https://\<something>.lab.my-domain.net**&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can customise "**onyxia**" and "**lab**" to your liking, for example you could chose **datalab.my-domain.net** and **\*.kub.my-domain.net**.
{% endhint %}

### SSL

In this section we will obtain a TLS certificate issued by [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) using the [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) commend line tool then get our ingress controller to use it. &#x20;

```bash
brew install certbot #On Mac, lookup how to install certbot for your OS

#Because we need a wildcard we have to complete the DNS callange.  
sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns

# When asked for the domains you wish to optains a certificate for enter:
#   *.lab.my-domain.net onyxia.my-domain.net
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The obtained certificate needs to be renewed every three month. &#x20;

To avoid the burden of having to remember to re-run the `certbot` command periodically you can setup [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) and configure a [DNS01 provider](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/#delegated-domains-for-dns01) on your cluster but that's out of scope for Onyxia.
{% endhint %}

Now we want to create a Kubernetes secret containing our newly obtained certificate: &#x20;

```bash
sudo kubectl create secret tls onyxia-tls \
    -n ingress-nginx \
    --key /etc/letsencrypt/live/lab.my-domain.net/privkey.pem \
    --cert /etc/letsencrypt/live/lab.my-domain.net/fullchain.pem
```

Lastly, we want to tell our ingress controller to use this TLS certificate, to do so run: &#x20;

```bash
kubectl edit deployment ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx
```

This command will open your configured text editor, go to line `56` and add: &#x20;

```yaml
        - --default-ssl-certificate=ingress-nginx/wildcard
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Test on your machine" %}
If you are on a Mac or Window computer you can install [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) then enable Kubernetes.

![Enable Kubernetes in Docker desktop](<.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
Docker desktop isn't available on Linux, you can use [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) instead.
{% endhint %}

### Port Forwarding

You'll need to [forward the TCP ports 80 and 443 to your local machine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6702424/174459930-23fb577c-11a2-49ef-a082-873f4139aca1.png).  It's done from the administration panel of your domestic internet Box. If you're on a corporate network, no luck for you I'm afraid.

### DNS

Let's assume you own the domain name **my-domain.net,** for the rest of the guide you should replace **my-domain.net** by a domain you actually own.

Get [your internet box routable IP](http://monip.org/) and create the following DNS records: &#x20;

```dns-zone-file
onyxia.my-domain.net A <YOUR_IP>
*.lab.my-domain.net  A <YOUR_IP>
```

{% hint style="success" %}
If you have DDNS domain you can create `CNAME` instead example: &#x20;

```
onyxia.my-domain.net CNAME jhon-doe-home.ddns.net.
*.lab.my-domain.net  CNAME jhon-doe-home.ddnc.net.
```
{% endhint %}

_**https://onyxia.my-domain.net**_ will be the URL for your instance of Onyxia.

The URL of the services created by Onyxia are going to look like: _**https://xxx.lab.my-domain.net**_

{% hint style="info" %}
`"lab"` and `"onyxia"` are mere suggestions.
{% endhint %}

### SSL

In this section we will obtain a TLS certificate issued by [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) using the [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) commend line tool. &#x20;

```bash
brew install certbot #On Mac, lookup how to install certbot for your OS

#Because we need a wildcard we have to complete the DNS callange.  
sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns

# When asked for the domains you wish to optains a certificate for enter:
#   *.lab.my-domain.net onyxia.my-domain.net 
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The obtained certificate needs to be renewed every three month. &#x20;

To avoid the burden of having to remember to re-run the `certbot` command periodically you can setup [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) and configure a [DNS01 provider](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/#delegated-domains-for-dns01) on your cluster but that's out of scope for Onyxia. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

Now we want to create a Kubernetes secret containing our newly obtained certificate: &#x20;

```bash
kubectl create namespace ingress-nginx
sudo kubectl create secret tls onyxia-tls \
    -n ingress-nginx \
    --key /etc/letsencrypt/live/lab.my-domain.net/privkey.pem \
    --cert /etc/letsencrypt/live/lab.my-domain.net/fullchain.pem
```

### Ingress controller

We'll install [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) in our cluster but any other ingress controller will do.

```bash
cat << EOF > ./ingress-nginx-values.yaml
controller:
  extraArgs:
    default-ssl-certificate: "ingress-nginx/onyxia-tls"
EOF

helm install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx \
    --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx \
    --namespace ingress-nginx \
    -f ./ingress-nginx-values.yaml
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

If you want to confirm that you are ready to move over to the next step you can [deploy a test web app on your cluster](misc.md#test-your-kubernetes-cluster).

### Installing Onyxia using helm

In this section we assume that:&#x20;

* You have a Kubernetes cluster and `kubectl` configured
* **onyxia.my-domain.net** and **\*.lab.my-domain.net** are pointing to your cluster's external address. **my-domain.net** being a domain that you own. You can customise "**onyxia**" and "**lab**" to your liking, for example you could chose **datalab.my-domain.net** and **\*.kub.my-domain.net**.
* You have an ingress controller configured with a default TLS certificate for **\*.lab.my-domain.net** and **onyxia.my-domain.net**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
As of today [the default service catalog](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/helm-charts-datascience) will only work with [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/). &#x20;

This will be addressed in the near future. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

```bash
helm repo add inseefrlab https://inseefrlab.github.io/helm-charts

cat << EOF > ./onyxia-values.yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
  hosts:
    - host: onyxia.my-domain.net
api:
  regions: 
    [
      {
        "services": {
          "expose": { "domain": "lab.my-domain.net" }
        }
      }
    ]
EOF

helm install onyxia inseefrlab/onyxia -f onyxia-values.yaml
```

&#x20;You can now access `https://onyxia.my-domain.net` and start services. Congratulations! ü•≥

At the moment the Onyxia you just deployed is running in degraded mode, there is no user authentication and no s3 integration for example. &#x20;

Let's see how to enable theres features.
