# ðŸ“– This website

To edit this documentation website you have two options.&#x20;

On every page there is a "[Edit on GitHub](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/docs.onyxia.sh)" link on the right of the page.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

This enables you to edit the Markdown files that are the source of this website and submit a PR to us even if you aren't a member of the [InseeFrLab organisation](https://github.com/InseeFrLab). &#x20;

However this isn't the best editing experience. To get access to the [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) online editor please request an access by sending an email to [joseph.garrone@data.gouv.fr](mailto:joseph.garrone@data.gouv.fr). &#x20;
