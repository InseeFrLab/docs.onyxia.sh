# â¬† v4 -> v5

The primary breaking change in this release pertains to Keycloak configuration. With this update, you're no longer limited to using Keycloak; any OIDC-compliant identity provider is now supported.\
To accommodate this new feature, you'll need to make some adjustments to your existing region configuration.
